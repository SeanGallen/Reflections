Don't Fall for the Prodigy Myth

"It is the quiet girl waiting in the wing with determination" whose "humble and hardwork" proves successful
in the long run.  Early praise can be harmful if the person falls for it. The never give up
mindset combined with a nonjudgmental view of mistakes is what propels people to success. Effort is an
experiment and it is a marathon not a sprint.
