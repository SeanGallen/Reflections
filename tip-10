Tip 10

Honor the Hard Sills

This tip is very important right now because I am trying to become good at programmming but ignoring
the hard skils.  Typing and the Vim editor or a tool like it is very important for my career.  If I can
get the idea out on the screen faster than I will be faster getting to a working code.

Technique is everything.

Skills are like a tree: Hard ones at the trunk and branches/leafs are the soft.

Resist the temptation of complexity and work on the task of honing and maintaining your hard skills,
because those form-quite literally-the foundation of everything else.

Hard skills even in coding are vital.
