Tip 8

To Build Hard Skills, Work Like a Careful Carpenter

Be slow and keenly attuned to errors.

Take each fundamental step and work on it to you master it.

Be humble about it.

When you learn hard skills, be precise and measured.
Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on.

Pay attention to errors and fix them.  Don't focus at them like a fault or failling
but as an examination for improvement.

If you have learned the wrong way while it might be difficult to repave the "Neru-pathways" it is best
to start again.
