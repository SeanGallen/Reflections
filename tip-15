Tip 15

Break every move down into Chunks


Any skill can be broken down into smaller pieces and mastered.  Think about the 4 steps to be a
good shooter.  Steady position, breathing, sight picture and tigger pull.

It is the same with programming.  Work on typing, break it down to home row and than build up to
numbers/stranger keys.  As for coding, find the 6 data structures and how they work.  Look at
similarities and than differences.  Work on loops and than methods. Once you master one chunk,
move on to another and master that one than add the 2 chunks together and repeat.

Look at these questions for guidances:

1) What is the smallest single element of this skill that I can master?
2) What other chunks link to that chunk?

See the whole thing. Break it down to its simplest elements. Put it back together. Repeat.
